//! UX flight recorder: a per-run JSONL trace of what the app *saw* (inputs,
//! coach reads, clock) and what it *did on screen* (computed geometry), so an
//! agent can debug rendering bugs from data instead of a human's description.
//!
//! A non-slice crate-level module (like [`coach`](crate::coach)). Wired in
//! `main.rs`, **not** `build_app` — headless tests must not sprout trace
//! directories; a test that wants the recorder adds [`TracePlugin`] explicitly
//! with a temp dir.
//!
//! Two halves:
//! 1. Port-side [`RecordingCoach`] decorator + shared [`TraceBuffer`].
//! 2. Bevy-side recording [`systems`] writing into a [`TraceWriter`].
//!
//! Scope boundary: Bevy-side bugs only. The trace records the feature/event
//! stream where it crosses the `AppCoach` port — never audio, never DSP
//! internals. Everything downstream of the drain is a deterministic function
//! of what is recorded; everything upstream is out of scope by design. And
//! everything is recorded from **Bevy's point of view**, per frame: the
//! per-frame drain batches are kept as-is (a frame that drained nothing, a
//! frame that drained three) because that jitter is itself a bug class; the
//! audio clock and Bevy's are never reconciled.
//!
//! Doctrine: recording computed pixels is pure observability output, not a
//! decision input — the same exemption telemetry has from the pixel-direction
//! rule (`ARCHITECTURE.md`).
//!
//! Deliberately not built (add only when the need actually bites):
//! screenshots (the `mark` record reserves a field; the semantic trace is
//! blind to z-order/color/fonts, and a bug class there is the trigger), a
//! trace diff/invariant-checker tool (grep/jq suffice until the queries get
//! repetitive), Bevy Remote Protocol (complementary live querying, not a
//! substitute), replay ergonomics (speed control, scrubbing, partial
//! replay), and any `traces/` retention policy (manual cleanup).
